# Monotree
Rust implementation of an optimized Sparse Merkle Tree.
This is a kind of binary-radix tree based on bitwise branching, _currently_, no nibble of bit.
For now, branching unit is just ___a single bit___, _neither a 4-bit nor a byte nibble_.

## Features
- Very __simple__ and __lightweight__, but __fast__ and __robust__.
- __Fully featured__ Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT) as a storage
- <u>This includes: __non-inclusion proof__, as well as __inclusion proof__, and its verification.</u>
- Again, _NOT verbose_ at all.

This library mostly relies on the _Rust standard library only_ except for `database APIs` and `hashers`.
Currently, `monotree` supports these databases and hash functions following, but is designed to be super easy to customize and add:

_Databases include_:
- [`HashMap`](https://lib.rs/crates/hashbrown)
- [`RocksDB`](https://lib.rs/crates/rocksdb)
- [`Sled`](https://lib.rs/crates/sled)

_Hashers include_:
- [`Blake3`](https://lib.rs/crates/blake3)
- [`Blake2s`](https://lib.rs/crates/blake2-rfc) and [`Blake2b`](https://lib.rs/crates/blake2-rfc)
- [`SHA-2`](https://lib.rs/crates/sha2)
- [`SHA-3 (Keccak)`](https://lib.rs/crates/sha3)

## Install
Add dependency to `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
monotree = "0.2.0"

# If you want to use it with specific database backends such as 'rocksdb' or 'sled',
monotree = { version = "0.2.0", features = ["db_rocksdb", "db_sled"] }
```

or use `cargo add`

```bash
$ cargo add monotree

$ cargo add monotree --features "db_rocksdb, db_sled"
```

## Quick start
> _from `examples/basic.rs`_

> Regarding __non-inclusion proof__ and __inclusion proof__, See _Merkle proof_ section in <u>More Examples</u> below.


```rust
use monotree::{Monotree, Result};
use monotree::utils::random_hash;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Init a monotree instance
    // by default, with 'HashMap' and 'Blake3' hash function
    let mut tree = Monotree::default();

    // It is natural the tree root initially has 'None'
    let root = None;

    // Prepare a random pair of key and leaf.
    // random_hash() gives a fixed length of random array,
    // where Hash -> [u8; HASH_LEN], HASH_LEN = 32
    let key = random_hash();
    let leaf = random_hash();

    // Insert the entry (key, leaf) into tree, yielding a new root of tree
    let root = tree.insert(root.as_ref(), &key, &leaf)?;
    assert_ne!(root, None);

    // Get the leaf inserted just before. Note that the last root was used.
    let found = tree.get(root.as_ref(), &key)?;
    assert_eq!(found, Some(leaf));

    // Remove the entry
    let root = tree.remove(root.as_ref(), &key)?;

    // surely, the tree has nothing and the root back to 'None'
    assert_eq!(tree.get(root.as_ref(), &key)?, None);
    assert_eq!(root, None);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Performance

<u>**All benchmarks were performed in a cumulative way**</u>, where the root resulting from an operation just before was reused for subsequent operations.
They were carried out <u>with randomly-generated bytes entries</u> and <u>from the root of an empty tree</u>. (Deletion starts from the last root.)

> Tested on: _Intel Core i5-3570 CPU @ 3.4GHz and 16 GB RAM / Ubuntu 18.04_ with `rustc stable 1.42.0`
> As a hasher, `Blake3` was used in this benchmark.

## Integration tests and benchmark
performs integration tests with full combinations of operations and tree types consisting of _Databases_ and _Hashers_ included.

```bash
    ## Some tests are time consuming.
    ## --release is optional, but without it, it will take a longer time to complete the tests
    $ cargo test --release --features "db_rocksdb, db_sled"
```

performs a micro-benchmark based on [`Criterion`](https://crates.io/crates/criterion), with full combinations of operations and tree types consisting of _Databases_ and _Hashers_ included.

```bash
    $ cargo bench --features "db_rocksdb, db_sled"
```

and macroscopic-time benchmarks (but rather wider error bars) with all tree types were also prepared in _`examples/perf.rs`_.

```bash
    $ cargo run --release --example perf --features "db_rocksdb, db_sled"
```

and some examples describing how to manipulate `monotree`

```bash
    $ cargo run --example basic
    $ cargo run --example advanced --features "db_rocksdb"
```

## Further improvement

`monotree` is a special case among the generalized binary radix trees, I'd like to call it `PoT (Power Of Two) radix tree`.
<u>If `monotree` were generalized with `pow(2, n)` of nibbles as a branching unit</u>, _there would have been room for further performance improvement_.

This generalization is now on progress.

## More Examples

> _from `examples/advanced.rs`_

```rust

use monotree::utils::*;
use monotree::*;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Init a monotree instance:
    // manually select a db and a hasher as your preference
    // Monotree::<DATABASE, HASHER>::new(DB_PATH)
    // where DATABASE = {MemoryDB, RocksDB, Sled}
    //         HASHER = {Blake3, Blake2s, Blake2b, Sha2, Sha3}
    let mut tree = Monotree::<RocksDB, Blake2b>::new("/tmp/monotree");

    // It is natural the tree root initially has 'None'
    let root = None;

    // Prepare 500 random pairs of key and leaf.
    // random_hashes() gives Vec<Hash>
    // where Hash is a fixed length of random array or [u8; HASH_LEN]
    let n = 500;
    let keys = random_hashes(n);
    let leaves = random_hashes(n);

    // Insert a bunch of entries of (key, leaf) into tree.
    // looks quite similar with 'monotree::insert()', but for insertion using batch.
    // 'inserts()' is much faster than 'insert()' since it's based on the following:
    // (1) DB batch-write, (2) sorting keys before insertion, and (3) mem-cache.
    let root = tree.inserts(root.as_ref(), &keys, &leaves)?;
    assert_ne!(root, None);

    // Similarly, there are methods 'gets()' and 'removes()' for batch use of
    // 'get()' and 'remove()', respectively.
    let result = tree.gets(root.as_ref(), &keys)?;
    assert_eq!(result.len(), keys.len());

    let root = tree.removes(root.as_ref(), &keys)?;
    // surely, the tree has nothing nad the root back to 'None'
    assert_eq!(root, None);

    // `Monotree` has compressed representation, but it fully retains
    // the properties of the Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT).
    // Thus, `non-inclusion proof` is quite straightforward. Just go walk down
    // the tree with a key (or a path) given. If we cannot successfully get a leaf,
    // we can assure that the leaf is not a part of the tree.
    // The process of inclusion proof is below:

    // random pre-insertion for Merkle proof test
    let root = tree.inserts(root.as_ref(), &keys, &leaves)?;

    // pick a random key from keys among inserted just before
    let key = keys[99];

    // generate the Merkle proof for the root and the key
